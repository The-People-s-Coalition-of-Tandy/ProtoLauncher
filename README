## How it Works

### ðŸŽ¯ The DigiCD Format
DigiCDs are PNG images that contain hidden MP3 data, allowing music to be stored and shared as images while maintaining full audio quality. When a DigiCD is loaded into the player, it:

1. Validates the PNG header
2. Extracts the embedded MP3 data
3. Creates an audio blob for playback
